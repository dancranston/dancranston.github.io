<h2>Expository</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="slides/k-critical-survey.pdf">A Survey of k-critical Graphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" /> 
A graph G is <i>k-critical</i> if G has chromatic number k, but every subgraph of G has chromatic number less than k.
This is a survey talk on k-critical graphs for a workshop at the American Institute of Mathematics (in Pasadena, CA)
in October 2024.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="slides/edge-coloring-survey.pdf">Edge-coloring Multigraphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This is a 2017 survey talk on edge-coloring both simple graphs and multigraphs (that
also mentions a few recent results of Landon Rabern and me).  For simple graphs
we focus on classes where chromatic index equals maximum degree.  For
multigraphs, we study a powerful recoloring tool, Tashkinov trees.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="slides/moore.pdf">No More Moore Graphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This is an expository talk, proving the famous result of Hoffman and Singleton
that 
Moore graphs exist only for regular graphs of degree 2, 3, 7, or (possibly) 57.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="slides/bertrands.pdf">A proof of Bertrand's Postulate</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This result states that for every positive integer n, there exists a prime p
such that n &lt; p &#8804; 2n.  This is an expository talk I gave at
Davidson, showcasing a beautiful proof due to Erdos.
Our presentation follows that in "Proofs from the Book". 
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="slides/nowhere-zero-talk.pdf">An Introduction to Nowhere-zero
Flows</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
For a planar graph, a nowhere-zero flow is equivalent to a
face-coloring.  However, they are also defined for non-planar graphs.  In other
words, nowhere-zero flows generalize the notion of face-coloring to non-planar
graphs.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="slides/pent_thm.pdf">Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem</a><br> 
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This result gives an
explicit value for each coefficient in the expansion of the infinite
product &#928;<sub>k&#8805;1</sub>(1-x<sup>k</sup>).  We present a pretty bijective proof
using integer partitions.
</li></ul>

<h2>Research</h2>
<font style="font-family: Lora; font-size: 18px">
Below are the slides from most of my research talks. (But generally only one version of the slides is included, even if I gave the talk multiple times at different venues.)  They appear in approximate reverse chronological order.

<li><a href="slides/list-reconfig-talk.pdf">Rosenfeld Counting: Proper Conflict-free Coloring of Graphs with Large Maximum Degree</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
A proper conflict-free coloring is a proper coloring such that each non-isolated vertex has a color that is used exactly once on its (open) neighborhood.  We prove that every graph has such a coloring from a list assignment L whenever |L(v)| &ge; 1.656&Delta; when &Delta;, the maximum degree, is big enough.  This talk doubles as an introduction to Rosenfeld counting, which is similar to the 
Lovasz Local Lemma, but often requires fewer technical details.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/squares-2degenerate-talk.pdf">Cliques in Squares of Graphs with Maximum Average Degree less than 4</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
We show that if a graph G has maximum average degree less than 4 and maximum degree at most D, then G<sup>2</sup> has clique number
at most 5D/2+532.  In the special case that G is 2-degenerate, this bound improves to 5D/2+72.  This is best possible up to the additive constant, due to a construction that achieves the lower bound 5D/2.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/list-reconfig-talk.pdf">Optimally Reconfiguring List Colorings Given Large Lists</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
Let L be a list-assignment with |L(v)|&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;d(v)&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 for all vertices v of a graph G.  Cambie, Cames van Batenburg, and I conjectured that every L-coloring of G can be reconfigured into every other L-coloring (at each step, recoloring a single vertex and maintaining a proper L-coloring) using at most n(G)&nbsp;+&nbsp;&mu;(G) steps. (Here n(G) is the order of G and &mu;(G) is its matching number.)  In these slides, we survey related results and prove two weaker forms of the conjecture.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/toroidal-Kempe-talk.pdf">In Most 6-regular Toroidal Graphs All 5-colorings are Kempe Equivalent</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
        An <font class="math">&alpha;,&beta;</font>-Kempe swap in a properly colored graph interchanges the colors on some component of the subgraph induced by colors <font class="math">&alpha;</font> and <font class="math">&beta;</font>. Two k-colorings of a graph are k-Kempe equivalent if we can form one from the other by a sequence of Kempe swaps (never using more than k colors).  Here we show that for most 6-regular toroidal graphs (of which there are infinitely many) all 5-colorings are
Kempe equivalent.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/swappability-talk.pdf">Kempe Equivalent List Colorings</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
        <!--An <font class="math">&alpha;,&beta;</font>-Kempe swap in a properly colored graph interchanges the colors on some component of the subgraph induced by colors <font class="math">&alpha;</font> and <font class="math">&beta;</font>. Two k-colorings of a graph are k-Kempe equivalent if we can form one from the other by a sequence of Kempe swaps (never using more than k colors). -->
(<i>k-Kempe equivalence</i> is defined in the previous paragraph.)
Las Vergnas and Meyniel showed that if a graph is (k-1)-degenerate, then each pair of its k-colorings are k-Kempe equivalent. Mohar conjectured the same conclusion for connected k-regular
            graphs. This was proved for k&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 by Feghali, Johnson, and Paulusma (with a single exception K<sub>2</sub>&#9744;K<sub>3</sub>, also called the 3-prism) and for k&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;4 by Bonamy, Bousquet, Feghali, and Johnson.
            In this paper we prove an analogous result for list-coloring. <br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />

        For a list-assignment L and an L-coloring <font class="math">&phi;</font>, a Kempe swap is called L-valid for <font class="math">&phi;</font> if performing the Kempe swap yields another L-coloring. Two L-colorings are called L-equivalent if we can form one from the other by a sequence of L-valid Kempe swaps. Let G be a connected k-regular graph with k&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3. We prove that if L is a k-assignment, then all L-colorings are L-equivalent (again with a single exception K<sub>2</sub>&#9744;K<sub>3</sub>).
When k&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;4, the proof is completely self-contained, so implies an alternate proof of the result of Bonamy et al.
Our proofs rely on the following key lemma, which may be of independent interest. Let H be a graph such that for every degree-assignment L<sub>H</sub> all L<sub>H</sub>-colorings are L<sub>H</sub>-equivalent. If G is a connected graph that contains H as an induced subgraph, then for every degree-assignment L<sub>G</sub> for G all L<sub>G</sub>-colorings are L<sub>G</sub>-equivalent.

<a href="slides/near-bipartite-talk.pdf">Using the Potential Method to Color
Near-bipartite Graphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
A graph is <i>near-bipartite</i> if we can partition its vertex set into sets I
and F so that I is an independent set and F induces a forest.  All 2-colorable
graphs are near-bipartite and all near-bipartite graphs are 3-colorable, and
each containment is proper.  Determining if a graph is near-bipartite is
NP-hard (not surprisingly).  We give a sufficient condition for a graph to be
near-bipartite, and it is sharp infinitely often.
<br><br>

</li><li>
<a href="slides/vertex-partitions-talk.pdf">Vertex Partitions into an Independent Set
and a Forest with Each Component Small</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This work refines the result in the previous paragraph.  We want to partition
V(G) into sets
I and F<sub>k</sub> so that I is an independent set and F induces a forest with
each tree of order at most k.  We call this an (I,F<sub>k</sub>) partition.
For each integer k &#8805; 2, we determine a sharp bound on mad(G) such that V(G)
has an (I,F<sub>k</sub>) partition.
For each k we construct an infinite family of examples showing our result is
best possible.
<!--Hendrey, Norin, and Wood asked for the largest function g(a,b) such that if
mad(G) &lt; g(a,b) then V(G) has a partition into sets A and B such that
mad(G[A]) &lt; a and mad(G[B]) &lt; b. They specifically asked for the value of
g(1,b), which corresponds to the case that A is an independent set. Previously,
the only values known were g(1,4/3) and g(1,2). We find the value of g(1,b)
whenever 4/3 &lt; b &lt; 2.-->

<a href="slides/circular-coloring-talk.pdf">Circular Coloring of Planar
Graphs</a><br>
<br style="line-height: 6px" />
We study sufficient conditions for a planar graph with large girth to have a homomorphism to
an odd cycle.  This problem generalizes Grotzsch's Theorem that all triangle-free planar graphs are 3-colorable.
Here we show that (if G is planar, then) girth at least 10 implies a homomorphism to C<sub>5</sub> and girth at least 16 implies
a homomorphism to C<sub>7</sub>.

<a href="slides/percolation-talk.pdf">Bootstrap Percolation Thresholds in Plane Tilings
using Regular Polygons</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
Bootstrap Percolation models the spread of disease.  If a face is healthy, but
has k infected neighbors, then the face becomes infected.  For a plane graph G,
we randomly infect some of the faces (each independently, with probability p),
and ask for the probability that eventually all faces become infected.  The
<i>percolation threshold</i> is the largest k such that this probability is at
least 1/2.  We find the thresholds for many tilings of the plane by regular
polygons, including for all Archimedean lattices.

<a href="slides/square-girth-5-talk.pdf">Coloring Squares of Planar Graphs of Girth
5</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This paper answers affirmatively a 2008 conjecture of Dvorak, Kral, Nejedly,
Skrekovski that, for some constant D, for every planar graph G with girth at least
5 and maximum degree at least D, the chromatic number of the square of G is at
most D+2.  (They had proved the same for girth 6.)  We prove their conjecture in
the more general setting of online list coloring.

<a href="slides/slovakia-talk.pdf">Fractional Coloring of Planar Graphs and the
Plane</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This an invited talk that I gave at the 24<sup>th</sup> Workshop on Cycles and
Colourings, in Slovakia.  It begins with a brief survey of fractional coloring,
sketches the proof that planar graphs are 9/2-colorable (see below), then
outlines a proof for a new lower bound on the fractional chromatic number of the
plane (here we are coloring all points of the plane and two points get disjoint
color sets if they are at distance exactly 1 in the plane).  I gave a <a href="slides/plane-fractional.pdf">related talk</a> at VCU that just presents the
lower bound for fractionally coloring the plane.
<br><br>
</li><li>
<a href="slides/planar-fractional-talk.pdf">Planar graphs are 9/2-colorable and have
big independent sets</a>
(Here's <a href="slides/planar-fractional-SFU.pdf">another version</a>
for a more expert audience.)<br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
The 4 Color Theorem says that every planar graph has a proper coloring with 4
colors.  But the proof relies heavily
on computers.  The 5 Color Theorem is analogous (but weaker), although it has a
simple proof.  Here we prove something in between: a 9/2 Color Theorem, which
does not need computers for the proof.

</li><li>
<a href="slides/antimagic-odd-talk.pdf">Regular Graphs of Odd Degree are
Antimagic</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
A labeling of a graph G is a bijection from its edges to the integers
1,2,...,|E(G)|.  The sum at a vertex (given a labeling) is the sum of labels on
edges incident to that vertex.  A labeling is antimagic if all of these sums are
distinct.  We prove that every regular graph of odd degree (at least 3) has an
antimagic labeling.

</li><li>
<a href="slides/painting-squares-talk.pdf">Painting Squares with &#916;<sup>2</sup>-1
colors</a>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
Here we consider the problem of (online) list-coloring the square of a graph
G with maximum degree &#916;. We prove that &#916;<sup>2</sup>-1 colors
suffice, except for the obvious case when G<sup>2</sup> has a clique of size at
least &#916;<sup>2</sup>.

        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
This is a departure from what I normally do.  It's joint work with Candace
Kent, my colleague at VCU.  The proofs use epsilons, deltas, and a bit of
elementary number theory (but no graphs).
<br><br>

</li><li>Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that if G has maximum degree &#916; &#8805;
9 and no clique of size &#916;, then the chromatic number of G is at most
&#916;-1.  We prove partial results on this conjecture.

</li><li><a href="slides/spies-talk.pdf">Revolutionaries and Spies</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
We study a game on a graph G played by r <i>revolutionaries</i> and s <i>spies</i>. Initially, revolutionaries and then spies occupy vertices. In each subsequent round, each revolutionary may move to a neighboring vertex or not move, and then each spy has the same option. The revolutionaries win if m of them meet at some vertex having no spy (at the end of a round); the spies win if they can avoid this forever. We provide conditions for the spies to win on various classes of graphs.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/overlap-talk.pdf">Overlap Number of Graphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
An <i>overlap representation</i> of a graph G assigns sets to vertices so that vertices are adjacent if and only 
if their assigned sets intersect with neither containing the other.  We prove upper bounds on the size of the base set
needed for such a representation of all n-vertex graphs in various families such as trees, planar graphs, bipartite graphs, and all graphs.

</li><li><a href="slides/crossings-talk-updated.pdf">Crossings, Colorings, and Cliques</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
Albertson conjectured that if a graph G has chromatic number k, then its crossing number (minimum number of edge crossings in a 
plane drawing of G) is at least the crossing number of K<sub>k</sub>.  Previously, this was know for all k &le; 6.  Here we extend
it to all k &le; 12.

</li><li><a href="slides/72-talk.pdf">(7,2)-edge-choosability of Some 3-regular Graphs</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
In a 3-regular graph, a list-assignment L gives to each edge e a set L(e) of 7 available colors.
We consider sufficient conditions under which we can choose a set of 2 colors for each edge e from L(e) such that any two edges 
with a common endpoint choose disjoint sets of colors.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/starcoloring-talk.pdf">Star Coloring Planar Graphs with High Girth</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
A star coloring is a proper coloring in which each pair of colors induces a star forest (each component has at most one vertex with degree more than 1).  We prove that every planar graph with girth at least 13 has a star coloring that uses at most 4 colors.
<br><br>

</li><li><a href="slides/injective-talk.pdf">Injective Coloring</a><br>
        <br style="line-height: 6px" />
An <i>injective</i> coloring of a graph gives distinct colors to each pair of vertices with a common neighbor.
The maximum average degree of graph G, denoted mad(G), is the largest average degree of all its subgraphs.
Let G be a graph with maximum degree 3.  We show that G has an injective coloring (a) with 5 colors if mad(G)&lt; 36/13
and (b) with 4 colors if mad(G)&lt; 5/2.
