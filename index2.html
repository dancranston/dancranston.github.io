Below are links to some things that I have written.
<ul>
<li>My book is titled Graph Coloring Methods (link coming soon).
<li><i>
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X1630379X">An Introduction to the Discharging Method via Graph Coloring</a></i> is coauthored with Douglas West.
<br>
This is a shortened version of <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4434v1">A Guide to the Discharging Method</a></i>.
<li><i><a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/ds25">Coloring, List Coloring, and Painting Squares of Graphs (and other related problems)</a></i><br>
is a Dynamic Survey that I wrote for the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics.
<li>All of my other <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/cranston_d_1.html">articles</a> are on arXiv.
<li>For many of the math talks I've given over the years, you can view my <a href="slides/slides.html">slides</a>.
</ul>
