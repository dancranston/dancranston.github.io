<li><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/edge-coloring-survey.pdf">Edge-coloring Multigraphs</a><br>
This is a survey talk on edge-coloring both simple graphs and multigraphs (that
also mentions <br>a few recent results of Landon Rabern and me).  For simple graphs
we focus on classes where<br> chromatic index equals maximum degree.  For
multigraphs, we study a powerful recoloring tool, <br>Tashkinov trees.

<li><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/moore.pdf">No More Moore Graphs</a><br>
This is an expository talk, proving the famous result of Hoffman and Singleton
that<br> 
Moore graphs exist only for regular graphs of degree 2, 3, 7, or (possibly) 57.

<li><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/bertrands.pdf">A proof of Bertrand's Postulate</a><br>
This result states that for every positive integer n, there exists a prime p
such that n &lt; p &#8804; 2n.<br>  This is an expository talk I gave at
Davidson, presenting a beautiful proof due to Erdos.

<li><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/nowhere-zero-talk.pdf">An Introduction to Nowhere-zero
Flows</a><br>For a planar graph, a nowhere-zero flow is equivalent to a
face-coloring.  However,<br> they are also defined for non-planar graphs.  In other
words, nowhere-zero flows<br> generalize the notion of face-coloring to non-planar
graphs.

<li><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/pent_thm.pdf">Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem</a><br> 
This result gives an
explicit value for each coefficient in the expansion of the infinite<br> 
product &#928;<sub>k&#8805;1</sub>(1-x<sup>k</sup>).  We present a pretty bijective proof
using integer partitions.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/near-bipartite-talk.pdf">Using the Potential Method to Color
Near-bipartite Graphs</a><br>
A graph is <i>near-bipartite</i> if we can partition its vertex set into sets I
and F so that I is an independent set and F induces a forest.  All 2-colorable
graphs are near-bipartite and all near-bipartite graphs are 3-colorable, and
each containment is proper.  Determining if a graph is near-bipartite is
NP-hard (not surprisingly).  We give a sufficient condition for a graph to be
near-bipartite, and it is sharp infinitely often.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/vertex-partitions-talk.pdf">Vertex Partitions into an Independent Set
and a Forest with Each Component Small</a><br>
This works refines the result in the previous paragraph.  We want to partition
V(G) into sets
I and F<sub>k</sub> so that I is an independent set and F induces a forest with
each tree of order at most k.  We call this an (I,F<sub>k</sub>) partition.
For each integer k &#8805; 2, we determine a sharp bound on mad(G) such that V(G)
has an (I,F<sub>k</sub>) partition.
For each k we construct an infinite family of examples showing our result is
best possible.
<!--Hendrey, Norin, and Wood asked for the largest function g(a,b) such that if
mad(G) &lt; g(a,b) then V(G) has a partition into sets A and B such that
mad(G[A]) &lt; a and mad(G[B]) &lt; b. They specifically asked for the value of
g(1,b), which corresponds to the case that A is an independent set. Previously,
the only values known were g(1,4/3) and g(1,2). We find the value of g(1,b)
whenever 4/3 &lt; b &lt; 2.-->

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/percolation-talk.pdf">Bootstrap Percolation Thresholds in Plane Tilings
using Regular Polygons</a><br>
Bootstrap Percolation models the spread of disease.  If a face is healthy, but
has k infected neighbors, then the face becomes infected.  For a plane graph G,
we randomly infect some of the faces (each independently, with probability p),
and ask for the probability that eventually all faces become infected.  The
<i>percolation threshold</i> is the largest k such that this probability is at
least 1/2.  We find the thresholds for many tilings of the plane by regular
polygons, including for all Archimedean lattices.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/square-girth-5-talk.pdf">Coloring Squares of Planar Graphs of Girth
5</a><br>
This paper answers affirmatively a 2008 conjecture of Dvorak, Kral, Nejedly,
Skrekovski that, for some constant D, for every planar graph G with girth at least
5 and maximum degree at least D, the chromatic number of the square of G is at
most D+2.  (They had proved the same for girth 6.)  We prove their conjecture in
the more general setting of online list coloring.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/slovakia-talk.pdf">Fractional Coloring of Planar Graphs and the
Plane</a><br>
This an invited talk that I gave at the 24<sup>th</sup> Workshop on Cycles and
Colourings, in Slovakia.  It begins with a brief survey of fractional coloring,
sketches the proof that planar graphs are 9/2-colorable (see below), then
outlines a proof for a new lower bound on the fractional chromatic number of the
plane (here we are coloring all points of the plane and two points get disjoint
color sets if they are at distance exactly 1 in the plane).  I gave a <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/plane-fractional.pdf">related talk</a> at VCU that just presents the
lower bound for fractionally coloring the plane.

</li><li>
<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/planar-fractional-talk.pdf">Planar graphs are 9/2-colorable and have
big independent sets</a><br>
(Here's <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/planar-fractional-SFU.pdf">another version</a>
for a more expert audience.)<br>
The 4 Color Theorem says that every planar graph has a proper coloring with 4
colors.<br>  But the proof relies heavily
on computers.  The 5 Color Theorem is analogous (but weaker),<br> although it has a
simple proof.  Here we prove something in between: a 9/2 Color Theorem,<br> which
does not need computers for the proof.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/antimagic-odd-talk.pdf">Regular Graphs of Odd Degree are
Antimagic</a><br>
A labeling of a graph G is a bijection from its edges to the integers
1,2,...,|E(G)|.  The sum at a vertex (given a labeling) is the sum of labels on
edges incident to that vertex.  A labeling is antimagic if all of these sums are
distinct.  We prove that every regular graph of odd degree (at least 3) has an
antimagic labeling.

<a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dcranston/slides/painting-squares-talk.pdf">Painting Squares with &#916;<sup>2</sup>-1
colors</a><br>  
Here we consider the problem of (online) list-coloring the square of a graph
G with maximum degree &#916;. <br>We prove that &#916;<sup>2</sup>-1 colors
suffice, except for the obvious case when G<sup>2</sup> has a clique of size at
least &#916;<sup>2</sup>.

Boundedness of Positive Solutions of the Reciprocal Max-Type Difference Equation
x<sub>n</sub>=max<sub>1&lt;i&lt;t</sub>(A<sup>i</sup><sub>n</sub>-1/x<sub>n-i</sub>)
with Periodic Parameters</a>
<br>This is a departure from what I normally do.  It's joint work with Candace
Kent, my colleague at VCU.<br>  The proofs use epsilons, deltas, and a bit of
elementary number theory (but no graphs).
<br><br>

</li><li>Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that if G has maximum degree &#916; &#8805;
9<br> and no clique of size &#916;, then the chromatic number of G is at most
&#916;-1.<br>
